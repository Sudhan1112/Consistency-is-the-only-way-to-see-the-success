# Arrays (DSA Notes)

Arrays are the foundation for many DSA problems. Different **patterns** help solve different types of problems efficiently.  
This mindmap organizes problems by **pattern â†’ problem type â†’ example**.

## ðŸ”¹ Linear Scan (Baseline)

> Pattern Idea: Just scan the array once (or twice), keep track of the needed values.  
> Best for **extreme value problems** (max, min, second largest, etc.).  
> Time: O(n), Space: O(1).

- **Find Maximum Element**  
  - Example: `arr = [5, 10, 2, 8] â†’ max = 10`

- **Find Minimum Element**  
  - Example: `arr = [5, 10, 2, 8] â†’ min = 2`

- **Find Second Largest Element**  
  - Optimized: Track two variables (`largest`, `secondLargest`) in one pass.  
  - Example: `arr = [10, 20, 5, 8] â†’ second largest = 10`

- **Move Zeros to End (continuous scan + overwrite)**  
  - Idea: Scan array, shift non-zero elements forward, fill remaining with zeros.  
  - Time: O(n), Space: O(1).  
  - Example: `arr = [0,1,0,3,12] â†’ [1,3,12,0,0]`  

Takeaway: Linear scan baseline is the cleanest choice for simple ranking, shifting, and placement problems.

## ðŸ”¹ Two Pointers

> Pattern Idea: Use two indices moving towards each other (or in the same direction) to reduce nested loops.  
> Best for **sorted arrays, subarray sums, or pairing problems**.

- **Pair with target sum**  
- **Remove duplicates from sorted array**  
- **Container with most water**  
- **Move Zeros to End (partitioning style)**  
  - `i` scans entire array, `j` tracks next position for non-zero.  
  - When `arr[i] != 0`, place at `arr[j]` and increment `j`.  
  - After loop, fill rest with zeros.  
  - Example: `arr = [0,1,0,3,12] â†’ [1,3,12,0,0]`

## ðŸ”¹ Sliding Window

> Pattern Idea: A "window" slides over the array while maintaining some running info (sum, frequency, etc.).  
> Best for **subarray and substring problems**.

- **Maximum sum subarray of size k**  
- **Longest subarray with sum â‰¤ K**  
- **Minimum window substring (string variant)**  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Heap / Priority Queue

> Pattern Idea: Use a heap (binary tree stored as an array) to efficiently track **top-k elements** or **k-th statistics**.  
> Best for **order statistics, frequency counts, and streaming problems**.

- **Find Second Largest (special case of K-th Largest)**  
  - Example: `arr = [5, 10, 20, 10] â†’ second largest = 10`  

- **Future Problems (to add later)**:  
  - Find K-th largest element  
  - Top-K frequent elements  
  - Running median of a stream  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Binary Search

> Pattern Idea: Divide and conquer by halving search space. Works on **sorted arrays** or **monotonic conditions**.  
> Best for **searching problems and optimization (binary search on answer)**.

- **Search element in sorted array**  
- **Search in rotated sorted array**  
- **Find minimum in rotated sorted array**  
- **Allocate minimum pages (binary search on answer)**
