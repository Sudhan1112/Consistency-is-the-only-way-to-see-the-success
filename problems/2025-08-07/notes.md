## 🧠 Problems Solved:
1. Reverse Array
2. Is Palindrome

---

## ✅ Problem #1: Reverse Array
### ⭐ Concept:
- Two-pointer technique to swap elements.
- Start from ends, move toward center.

### 🛠️ Time Complexity:
- `O(n)` — Single pass through the array.

### 🧠 Space Complexity:
- `O(1)` — In-place reversal.

---

## ✅ Problem #2: Is Palindrome
### ⭐ Concept:
- Compare string with its reverse or use two-pointer.

### 🛠️ Time Complexity:
- `O(n)`

### 🧠 Space Complexity:
- `O(1)` if in-place check, else `O(n)` if reversed string is stored.
